# #Mountain Paths 
## Description
The Mountain Paths Project was created to use different algorithms to find the "best" path through the imported dataset of mountains calculating for change in elevation (with some visualization). I developed two possible solutions to the problem.

### Greedy Algorithm (v1) 

The greedy algorithm requires the same parameters as the A star Algorithm, however, it calculates the best path by making a set of decisions, with each decision being decided by the most immediate benefit provided. In this case, the greedy algorithm looks for the easiest change in altitude to switch to given two (or more) choices. 


### A Star Algorithm (v2) 

The idea is you can set your starting place and compute the most efficient path to a certain ending place using the best-first searfch method.
